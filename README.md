# Credit-calculator

## The following tools/languages will be used in this project;
***Vanilla Javascript**<br>
***HTML**<br>
***CSS**

## The goal of the project
**In this project, I handled the loan structure in a simple and understandable way.**
**And while I was building this structure, I took fixed interest rates as an example.**
**On the right side of the page, the interest rate percentage is written according to the selected month in the form of a table.**

## How It's Used
**User enters how much money they want to withdraw,then the user chooses how many months he wants to pay from the options.<br>**
**Finally, the user clicks on the "Calculate Loan Repayment Terms" button and sees the results.<br>**

## Output of the code
**First, the total amount that the user will return is written at the top.<br>**
**Secondly, it says how much the user will reimburse each month.<br>**
**Finally, the difference between the amount the user wants to withdraw and the amount to be paid back is written.**
