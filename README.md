# Credit-calculator

## The following tools/languages will be used in this project;
***Javascript**<br>
***HTML**<br>
***CSS**

## The goal of the project
**The aim of the project is to prioritize algorithm skills and to have a good grasp of simple Javascript logic.**
**Understanding the logic of making snow effect using CSS and Javascript structure (especially Javascript) can be used in different examples based on this.**

## Output of the code
**First,The time left until the New Year is displayed on the output of the code. Since we use a dynamic structure, this counter starts to count again every year.<br>**
**For example, it is currently counting down to 2024, but when we enter 2024, it will automatically start counting down to 2025.<br>**

## The code structure required to make it dynamic
**The above snippet gets the current year.**
**In the second piece of code
The reason we add +1 to the current year is to determine the year we have chosen as the target.**

const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();

const newYearTime = new Date(`January 01 ${currentYear + 1} 00:00:00`);<br>
